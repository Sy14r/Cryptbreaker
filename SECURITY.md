## Reporting a Vulnerability

This project was made to securely utilize AWS but as it initially is intended for local hosting only extensive efforts to ensure the web application is secure haven't been fully performed.
If you find a vulnerability please feel free to email me directly at geoff[at]opensecurity.io or open an issue.

If the vulnerability is validated I'll work to push out a security fix in a timely manner and add a reference to you as a security contributor of the project.
